			<p>The Greene County District Attorney charged Linda Nelson with disability fraud, a Class II misdemeanor.</p>
			<p>Investigators were informed by Greene County Child Protective Services that Linda Nelson has had a repeat history of “doctor shopping” for her 19-year-old daughter. Recently, she stopped receiving state disability checks after it was discovered that Linda Nelson had been forging a doctor’s signature for years so she could continue receiving financial assistance on behalf of her daughter.</p>
