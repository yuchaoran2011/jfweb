			<p><strong>SPRINGFIELD, Mo.</strong> -- A Missouri teen has been found after the teen's mother was found murdered in their Springfield home, reports CBS affiliate KOLR.</p>
			<p>Tracy Nelson, 19, was found alive in Wis. early Thursday, officials said in a news release Thursday afternoon. She was reported missing after her mother Linda Nelson was found slain early Monday in their home, reports the station.</p>
			<p>Linda Nelsonâ€™s death was of a "violent nature," Greene County Sheriff Jim Arnott said Thursday. He reportedly wouldn't detail her cause of death.</p>
			<p>Authorities responded to the home after friends reportedly called police, saying they saw a disturbing post on the mother's Facebook page indicating she may have been harmed. A Facebook page that appears to belong to Nelson contains a message posted around 3:30 p.m. Sunday that reads, "That b---h is dead!"</p>
			<p>Deputy Cathy Ussery with the Greene County Sheriff's Office told 48 Hours Crimesider investigators are looking into the Facebook post and trying to determine who posted it -- whether it may have been one of the two women, another person connected to the investigation or someone who hacked into the account.</p>
			<p>Officers issued an "endangered persons advisory" for daughter Tracy Nelson before she was found with a young man, in the Village of Big Bend, Wis. -- nearly 600 miles from her home. She reportedly has Muscular Dystrophy and uses a wheelchair.</p>
			<p>Neighbors told the station they last saw Tracy Nelson last Wednesday. Linda's ex-husband was around there. He was arguing with Linda.</p>
			<p>Investigators say the believe the crime is a "targeted situation."</p>
			<p>"We do not feel that this is a random act at this point," Arnott said.</p>
