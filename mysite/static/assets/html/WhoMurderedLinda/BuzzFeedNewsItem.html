			<p>"Linda and Tracy are our neighbors. Outwardly, Linda and Tracy seemed close and happy. But when it was just me I saw a darker and secretive side of Tracy..yelled at her mom at one point. It was a totally uncomfortable situation… So I pulled away. Later, she said she would do anything to get away from her mom…that she was being smothered and just wanted to live a normal life. She was so sweet..kind of scary when mad though. Tracy also told me that she hated how her mom treated her and that she was not disabled.... Also, she walked instead of using her wheelchair when it was just me"</p>
