			<p>A journalist from Thought Catalog reached out to Ellen Pinegar, a girl who says she was very close with Tracy Nelson.</p>
			<p>Ellen Pinegar said she’s known Tracy since they were kids. Their moms are close friends and they both grew up in the Habitat for Humanity neighborhood in northwest Springfield.</p>
			<p>In October 2014, Tracy began messaging her through a secret Facebook page under the name Emma Rose.</p>
			<p>“Hi Ellen its Tracy,” the first post read. “This is my personal account my mom is still overprotective so she doesn’t know about this account.”</p>
			<p>Then Tracy began writing about her life:</p>
			<p>“I’m 17. Ken my boyfriend is 24, we met on a Christian Singles site, we love each other.”</p>
			<p>“He plans on popping the question sometime in 2016, and we want the wedding date to be in December of 2017. If all goes good we want a snow wedding in a gazebo with red and white roses.”</p>
			<p>“We are very serious we say we aren’t dating we are courting. Cuz we are both Catholic Christians.”</p>
