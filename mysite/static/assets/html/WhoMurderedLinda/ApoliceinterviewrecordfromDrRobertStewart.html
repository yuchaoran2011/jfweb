			<p>Dr. Robert Stewart contacted the police after hearing about Linda Nelson’s death.</p>

			<p>Dr. Robert Stewart is a pediatric neurologist in Springfield. He said Linda and Tracy visited him in 2010. He was not convinced that Tracy had muscular dystrophy because there was no sign of muscle weakness and she did not exhibit any of the symptoms of the condition. Linda told him she didn’t have Tracy’s medical records because they’d been destroyed in the Hurricane Katrina.</p>
			<p>Stewart contacted Tracy’s previous doctors in New Orleans and got the results of several diagnostic tests. “After analysing all the facts and talking to her previous pediatrician, I am reasonably certain that Tracy does not have Muscular Dystrophy. Although there is no way to make a formal diagnosis without talking to her mother, there is a strong possibility Tracy is a victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy”. Munchausen syndrome by proxy is a relatively rare form of child abuse where the primary caretaker garners sympathy and attention from others by fabricating a child’s illness. Linda and Tracy never returned to Doctor Stewart’s office after their initial visit.</p>
