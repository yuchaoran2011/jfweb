			<p>"Linda is my best friend, said by a single mother named Amy Pinegar. And my daughter Ellen is very close with Tracy. She told me that Tracy’s father was a deadbeat, an inveterate gambler, an alcoholic drug abuser who had mocked his daughter’s disabilities, called the Special Olympics a 'freak show.' He’d burned Tracy and her with cigarettes. Several days ago, Linda came to my home saying her home was robbed. She said she was afraid of her ex-husband coming back, stealing their money and taking Tracy away from her. As I understood it, he’d never sent them a dime, not even when Linda and Tracy had lost everything in Hurricane Katrina".</p>
