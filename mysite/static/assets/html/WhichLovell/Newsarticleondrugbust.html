			<p>Deputies found a resident tied up and bloody inside her River Oaks Landing home early this morning and then arrested her on drug charges, reports say.</p>
			<p>Julia Howser, 24, was bound and sitting on a couch when deputies forced their way into her house on 5670 Rouse Rd just before 1 a.m., according the Orange County Sheriff's Office.</p>
			<p>By Joseph Poser – Contact ReporterDeputies responded there to reports of a man being held at gunpoint outside the house. They found a "large" pool of blood and then made entry to "check the well being of those inside," an arrest report states.</p>
			<p>Deputies found Howser and immediately started emergency medical treatment, while others checked the home for any suspects. That's when they said they noticed marijuana, a scale, baggies and other drug paraphernalia in "plain view" in the living room, according to the report.</p>
			<p>Howser was being held at a local hospital for treatment before being booked into the Orange County Jail. She is facing charges of possession of marijuana with intent to sell and possession of drug paraphernalia.</p>
