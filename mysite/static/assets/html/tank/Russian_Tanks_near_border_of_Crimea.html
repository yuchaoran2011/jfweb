			<p style="margin-top: 10px"><i>According to Pentagon officials, Russia has increased its military presence in Crimea. It seems that the most modern Russian battle tanks will be stationed at a new air base established near the Crimean border.</i></p>

			<p>The amount of Russian weapons and equipment that is brought into the air base reveals Russia’s plan to use this airfield as a center for military supplies to support further operations in Crimea.</p>

			<p>Based on satellite footage, airfield south of Krasnos holds the following: approximately half a dozen Mark IX tanks, 15 howitzers, 35 armored personnel carriers, 200 marines and capacity for approximately 1,500 members of personnel.</p>

			<p>Russian foreign minister Sergey V. Lavrov said that Russia is providing Crimea with military supplies and it is logical that such shipments are accompanied by appropriate military specialists.</p>

			<p>Since Russia will continue to defend its annexation of Crimea, it inevitably causes further tension in Russia’s relations with the United States.</p>
