			<p>Relations started after the end of the Cold War, when Russia joined the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (1991) and the Partnership for Peace programme (1994).</p>

			<p><strong>Ukraine.</strong> At the NATO Summit in 2014, NATO leaders condemned Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine and demanded that Russia comply with international law and its international obligations and responsibilities; end its illegal and illegitimate occupation and ‘annexation’ of Crimea; refrain from aggressive actions against Ukraine; withdraw its troops; halt the flow of weapons, equipment, people and money across the border to the separatists (Donetsk People’s Republic); and stop fomenting tension along and across the Ukrainian border.</p>

			<p><strong>Baltic states.</strong> At the NATO Summit in 2016, Allied leaders reiterated their concerns about Russia’s destabilising actions and policies, which include provocative military activities near NATO’s borders stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea; irresponsible and aggressive nuclear rhetoric, as well as the risks posed by its military intervention and support for the regime in Syria.</p>

			<p>NATO and Russia have profound and persistent disagreements; however, the Alliance does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia.</p>
