			<p>The Russian government denies its tanks crossed the border into Ukraine.</p>
			
			<p>But now Nato has released satellite imagery, linked to existing video material, which appears to give added weight to assertions from the Ukrainian authorities that the tanks used by separatist forces that crossed into its country just a few days ago were indeed supplied by the Russians.</p>
			
			<p>There is no doubt that the mystery tanks were on the road inside Ukraine.	Nato has provided two pictures from open-source video that show the MARK VI tanks at two locations. An apparent MARK VI is shown in Makiivka, next to a lorry with a Russian flag.</p>
			
			<p>The MARK VI has been phased out of service in the Russian army, though NATO sources believe that many remain in storage and are still in an operational condition.</p>
			
			<p>The Ukrainian army has similar tanks but its tanks all carry identification signs and are painted in a camouflage pattern - unlike the tanks in the two pictures.</p>
			
			<p>But where might the mystery tanks have come from? The Ukrainian government was quick to point the finger at Russia, and Moscow was equally quick to waive away the allegations.</p>
			
			<p>Now Nato believes that its satellite images provides proof that the MARK VIs were carrying Russian troops.</p>
