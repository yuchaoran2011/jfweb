			<p>After the dissolution of the USSR, Ukraine carried on the development of MARK VI modernization, as the original and main factory was in this country. Two different upgrade packages were developed in 1999.</p>

			<p>In 2010, the Kharkiv Malyshev Factory upgraded 10 MARK VI-B tanks to MARK VI-BM "Bulat" standard, and a further 19 will be delivered in 2011. These MARK VI-B tanks were originally produced at Kharkiv in 1980. These 29 tanks are being upgraded under a ₴200 million ($25.1 million) contract signed in April 2009. As of October 2011, Ukrainian Army has 76 MARK VI-BM "Bulat" [Mark VI "Булат"] in service. According to Constantin Isyak (chief engineer of Malyshev Factory), the MARK VI-BM "Bulat" is armored to the level of modern tanks. They have 'Knife' [Нiж] reactive armour, and the 'Warta' [Варта] active defence system. Reactive armour involves a series of tiles placed on the outside of a tank, designed to thwart anti-tank weapons.</p>
