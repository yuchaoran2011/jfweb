				Donetsk People's Republic (a self-declared independent state within Eastern Ukraine) – multiple MARK VIs in service. At least 52 MARK VI tanks have been documented as captured in the war in Donbass by the warring parties. Russia has been accused of supplying these tanks to Donetsk forces by the United States Department of State and NATO based on intelligence and satellite imagery of their deployment. Insurgents confirmed they had obtained the tanks, but leaders refused to elaborate on how they acquired them; one militant told reporters they originated "from a military warehouse." Konstantin Mashovets, a former Ukrainian Defence Ministry official, said the tanks had likely been seized by Russian forces in Crimea before making their way into mainland Ukraine. Anton Heraschenko, an advisor to Arsen Avakov, confirmed at a briefing in Kiev that the tanks were once in the possession of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Crimea, and that they had been transferred by sea to Russia before crossing the border into Ukraine. At least one captured MARK VI-BV has shown matching serial numbers indicating it was in service in Crimea. On June 30, Ukrainian forces captured a MARK VI-BV in Donetsk region, after which the Ministry of Defense verified the serial numbers indicated the tank was issued to the Russian army and part of the 205th Infantry Brigade, which is stationed in the Russian city of Budenovskiy.</p>
