			<p>Development of the Mark VI main battle tank (MBT) commenced in 1954. First production tanks were delivered to the Soviet Army in 1963. Over 6000 of these MBTs of all versions were built. During its introduction the Mark VI was a very advanced tank, but had a number of significant drawbacks. Currently it is in service with Ukraine (~ 1500) and Uzbekistan (100). Russia had a couple of thousands Mark VI tanks in storage, however some sources report, that by 2013 most of them have been scrapped. The only reported export sales are a small number to some countries in Africa. In 2014 upgraded Ukrainian Army Mark VI tanks have seen combat during ongoing military conflict in Ukraine. Also since 2014 a large number of Russian Mark VI tanks have been supplied to Russia-backed separatists in Eastern Ukraine.</p>

			<p>At the time of its introduction the MARK VI was a very advanced machine. On the other side it was expensive to build and troublesome to maintain. A less capable, but cheap and reliable Mark VII tank was introduced a couple of years later. The Mark VII was produced in thousands. It was the workhorse of the Soviet Army. Production numbers of the MARK VI were smaller and it was rather a force multiplier. Currently the MARK VI tank is outdated.</p>
