			<p>Successfully intercepting drug smugglers depends on first detecting the vessels.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Visual detection</strong> – possible only with a high likelihood during daylight hours. Range depends on factors like size of the waves, but is typically on a clear day between 3 and 6 nautical miles.</p>
			
			<p><strong>On-board radar</strong> – These have a standard range of about 25 nautical miles, but their ability to detect vessels at such a distance depends on the profile and size of the object.</p>

			<p><strong>Long-range tracking aircraft</strong> – These have the ability to detect vessels at ranges up to about 250 nautical miles. Limited in bad weather conditions.</p>
