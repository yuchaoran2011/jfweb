			<p>Intercepts by the US Coast Guard need to occur in US territorial waters, or in international waters (more than 200 nautical miles from the coast of any country), or in the territorial waters of a country that has signed a cooperation agreement and has a representative of that country on board the vessel in pursuit. The US has signed cooperation agreements with Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama, and Belize.</p>
			
			<p>Drug smugglers will attempt to use this legal requirement to their advantage in trying to evade pursuit. For example, when chased in international waters, they will attempt to head into territorial waters in the hope that a US Coast Guard vessel will be forced to disengage from following them because of a lack of jurisdiction.</p>
			
			<p>(* Joint Interagency Task Force is a multiservice, multiagency task force that conducts counter illicit trafficking operations, intelligence fusion and multi-sensor correlation to detect, monitor, and handoff suspected illicit trafficking targets; promotes security cooperation and coordinates country team and partner nation initiatives in order to defeat the flow of illicit traffic.)</p>
