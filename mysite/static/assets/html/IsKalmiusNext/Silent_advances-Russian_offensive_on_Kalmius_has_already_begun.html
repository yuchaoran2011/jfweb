			<p>Large parts of the offensive Russian forces have moved south and will soon turn up in the greater Donetsk area as well as near the southern coastal city of Kalmius. This forecast has been confirmed by multiple analysts, including several sources on the ground in the southern Donetsk region. However, what seems not to have been realized by analysts and international media organizations yet is that the question whether or not an attack towards Kalmius will take place has already been answered.</p>

			<p>Ukrainian national guard forces were not willing to obey the suicidal “defense only” strategy by the military and political leadership in Kyiv, and decided to go on the attack. Within two days, they recaptured around 120 km² of Ukrainian land and established new fortified positions in a number of towns, some 10-15 east of Kalmius.</p>

			<p>But the joy was only brief. A few days later, Russian forces started massive attacks on the front, pushing Azov troops out of Shirokino and to the town’s eastern outskirts in a first stage of their counterattack. As a logical consequence of the uneven use of force, Ukrainian troops initially had to withdraw from 70% of the territories, liberated by the Regiment Azov earlier this month. Not even today, as the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs report the use of Russian army T-72 tanks to attack Regiment Azov positions near Shirokino, would the Ukrainian army command give its troops the needed artillery cover.</p>

			<p>Many people keep asking if Russian forces will attack Kalmius and capture it in another step to build a land corridor to Crimea, land also occupied by Russia. While some analysts believe that the Russian army and local separatists might directly attack or bypass and encircle the town, the cost for that move might be massive and possibly too high for both sides, especially taking into account that both sides will have a steady stream of supplies and reinforcements.</p>

			<p>Thus, the more likely scenario in the short term is that Russian forces will try to get back into the comfortable situation of controlling all smaller settlements east of Kalmius, being able to attack military and civilians targets in and around the town. Doing this, they would be able to inflict constant smaller casualties on the fixed Ukrainian line of defense, keeping the conflict boiling on a low but steady flame. At the same time, it would enable them to raise the stakes (such as an attack Kalmius itself).</p>
