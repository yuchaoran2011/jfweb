			<p>Deputy commander of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Viktor Savchuk contends that the armed forces of the Russian-backed Donetsk People's Republic attacked the Ukrainian position in order to get full control over the village of Shirokino, a village 50 miles east of Kalmius. According to the official report, there is a direct military clash of the opposing sides in Shirokino. "The direct fire continues, but the Ukrainian army continues to hold their position," Savchuk said in a statement on the Ministry’s website. Last night, a number of Ukrainian soldiers sustained wounds of varying degrees of severity, and one soldier has been killed. Earlier it was reported that military equipment, weapons and manpower were being prepared for a possible attack on the city of Kalmius, but these rumors have not been officially confirmed. "Currently, there are no preconditions for a massive attack by the Donetsk People’s Republic armed groups on Kalmius," Savchuk said.</p>
