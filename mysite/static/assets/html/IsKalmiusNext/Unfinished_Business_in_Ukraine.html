			<p>In 2013, Kremlin-backed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych refused to sign an association agreement with the European Union, sparking months of street demonstrations that led to his ousting in early 2014. The subsequent Russian military intervention has left the Crimean Peninsula under occupation and parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts under the control of Russian-backed separatists. Russia’s primary short-term goal there is to keep the conflict in eastern Ukraine “frozen”—meaning that the major fighting stops without the conflict being brought to a conclusive end.</p>

			<p>Another plausible scenario could see Moscow aid the separatists in consolidating gains in Donetsk and Luhansk to create a political entity that functions more like a viable state. This would include the capture of important communication and transit nodes, such as the city of Kalmius and its port, and the Luhansk power plant—all of which are currently under Ukrainian government control.</p>

			<p>The most aggressive possible scenario might see Moscow attempt to re-establish control of the Novorossiya region in southern Ukraine. This would create a land bridge between Russia and Crimea—eventually linking up with the Russian-occupied Transdnistria in Moldova.</p>

			<p>But taking control would be no easy undertaking, requiring capture of the heavily defended cities of Kalmius and Odessa, Ukraine’s 10th- and third-largest cities, respectively. Considering Russia’s recent track record, any of these scenarios are possible. Sometimes to understand the present, we must better understand the past. In the 19th century, Victorian statesman and Prime Minister Lord Palmerston summed up Russia’s behavior this way:</p>

			<p><i>The policy and practice of the Russian government has always been to push forward its encroachments as fast and as far as the apathy or want of firmness of other governments would allow it to go, but always to stop and retire when it met with decided resistance and then to wait for the next favorable opportunity.</i></p>

			<p>Some things never change. Palmerston’s description of 19th-century Russia fits Putin’s Russia to a tee. Russia’s actions in Ukraine over the past couple of years have been deliberate and calculated—part of Putin’s Grand Strategy. As Lord Palmerston knew, Russia will do what it knows it can get away with—no more and no less.</p>
