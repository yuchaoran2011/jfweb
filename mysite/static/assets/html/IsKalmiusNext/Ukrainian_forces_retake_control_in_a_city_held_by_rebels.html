			<p>Ukrainian security forces retook control of an eastern industrial city, Kalmius, that had been held by separatists. Troops swept into Kalmius and battled the militants for several hours, dismantling checkpoints and barricades, overrunning sniper positions and destroying an armored vehicle, Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said in an interview last night.</p>

			<p>He cited "high losses" among the militants and two wounded among the Ukrainian troops. "It is a pity that Kalmius was awakened by gunshots, but the city of steelmakers must not live and work as dictated by terrorists," Avakov said. "The situation in the city is stable. A Ukrainian national flag was hoisted over the Kalmius city council."</p>

			<p>Kalmius became the first major city in the in the restive Donetsk region to be retaken from separatist gunmen in two months of on-and-off fighting. Later in the day, President Petro Poroshenko ordered the regional authorities to set up their temporary headquarters in Kalmius, given that the city of Donetsk, the regional capital, remains largely controlled by pro-Russia gunmen.</p>
			<p>In Washington, meanwhile, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman confirmed a report from Ukrainian officials this week that tanks had crossed into their territory from Russia. "In the last three days a convoy of three T-64 tanks, several BM-21 or Grad multiple rocket launchers and other military vehicles crossed from Russia into Ukraine near the Ukrainian town of Snizhne," said spokeswoman Marie Hagmeier. "This is unacceptable."</p>
			<p>The operation in Kalmius could mark a turning point for confronting separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. "Our power structures finally got their act together and proved to be capable of conducting a large-scale military operation, kicking the terrorists out of a strategic town with minimal casualties," Ukrainian defense expert Yuriy Baraban said in a telephone interview.</p>
