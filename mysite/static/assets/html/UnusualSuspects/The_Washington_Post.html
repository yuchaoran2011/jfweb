			<p>Thousands and thousands of people have taken to the streets of Ukraine since Nov. 21, when President Viktor Yanukovych announced he would not sign a trade agreement with Europe but would pursue closer economic ties with Russia instead. Here are some names and places to know as events unfold in Ukraine:</p>

			<p><strong>Viktor Yanukovych (63).</strong> President of Ukraine (nominated by the Party of Regions) and Vladimir Putin's protégé. From the industrial eastern heartland of Donetsk, Yanukovych served time in prison in the Soviet era for assault. As president he has showered his immediate circle of Donetsk cronies with favors. Now everyone in Ukraine calls them "The Family."</p>

			<p><strong>Vitaly Klitschko (42).</strong>The former WBO and WBC heavyweight champion, he had a knockout-to-bout ratio second only to Rocky Marciano's. Now he's in politics, and his party is called UDAR, which means "punch".</p>

			<p><strong>The protesters.</strong>The crowds are large and varied, with many young people, but committed older ones as well. Many are pro-Europe. Others are simply anti-Russian. Thousands of others joined in to defend human rights, angry that protesters had been beaten.</p>

			<p><strong>The mercenaries.</strong>Shadowy state-authorised vigilantes, who work hand in hand with the police units and are used to intimidate opposition protesters, journalists, or whoever needed to be scared off.</p>
