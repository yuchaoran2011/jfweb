				<td style="padding: 25px;"><span>Photo: mercenary agents who supported the Ukrainian police force during the administration of Viktor Yanukovych, often posing as street hooligans with the express purpose of performing illegal acts. The agents were employed by the Yanukovych government with a reported daily pay of 200 UAH. Some of them were also suspected to be illegal formations of combat troops carrying concealed pistols. Their aim was to intimidate and disperse demonstrations by opponents of the government, and attack participants and representants of the media. Some suppose that groups of soccer fans and professional wrestlers are among them, and that they are among the most aggressive of them. Regarding this, one can conclude, based on how events have developed on the Maidan, that mercenaries indeed are connected with the police - or at least the police don't get in the way of their activities.</span></td>
