				<li>Russian opposition leader Ivan Koltsov, 55, was shot 4 times last year</li>
				<li>Father of four Koltsov was outspoken critic of president Vladimir Putin</li>
				<li>He was with his girlfriend Anna Sokaliuk, 24, when he was shot</li>
				<li>She gave statement to police and returned to her home country, Ukraine</li>
				<li>She is traumatised over killing and racy photos of her have emerged</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The model girlfriend of slain Russian opposition leader Ivan Koltsov has refused to give evidence at his murder trial after a leak of her 'erotic' pictures discovered by police at his flat. Glamorous Anna Sokaliuk is still traumatised over being with her lover - an outspoken political enemy of Vladimir Putin. The 24-year-old gave testimony to state investigators at the time, and was then allowed by the Russian authorities to travel home to Ukraine.</p>

			<p>A close relative of Sokaliuk in Ukraine strongly denied the claims that Anna was suffering psychological problems, and that this explained her refusal to attend court in Russia. 'She is healthy, and she is doing well,' the relative from Bila Tserkva told DailyMail. Born and raised in Bila Tserkva, Ms. Sokaliuk is said to be associated with Yuriy Nadoba, the martial arts champion who recently assaulted a reporter during a political protest. After graduating from high school, Anna studied accounting at Kyiv National Economic University. She dropped out after her second year to pursue a modeling career in Moscow, where she met Koltsov.</p>
