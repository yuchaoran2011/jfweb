			<p>The first hearing took place on Monday in the trial of Yuriy Nadoba, the young man accused of assaulting Svitlana Demkovych, Channel 9 journalist, during the events in Kyiv on 18 May.</p>

			<p>That afternoon, slightly away from the opposition rally, Svitlana Demkovych and her husband, Oleg Gotsa, stopped to photograph what appeared to be a group of young athletic men in tracksuits. Gotsa's camera clearly annoyed the assailants who hit out at him. One of them is videoed attacking Svitlana Demkovych. Both she and her husband asked the police for help. The latter watched the assault without intervening.</p>

			<p>"The man in a black tracksuit attacked us. We took pictures of him and he didn't like it at all," said the photographer. The outrage that followed meant that the main suspect - Yuriy Nadoba - was arrested and charged with "hooliganism". Questioned in parliament over the assault, Interior Minister Zakharchenko showed a video, supposedly made before Nadoba was arrested in which he asserts that he was there to "protect the opposition". The court also questioned a witness, a LIGA-Businessinform journalist Nelya Tarasenko, who stated that she saw Nadoba among the people providing security around the Party of the Regions stage on 18 May.</p>

			<p>The hearing was adjourned to 10 July due to the non-appearance of a witness. Nadoba was promptly released on bail and picked up by a female friend, who asked to remain anonymous. Nadoba faces up to 4 years imprisonment if convicted. Outside a group supporting Nadoba provoked a brawl during the hearing.</p>
